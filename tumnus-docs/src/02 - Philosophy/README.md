I want you to know it's important that we have standards. And it's definitely not because any are better than the other. It's just that at the end of the day when there are so many ways to do one thing, we just have to pick something. 

So if you don't like something you see here, don't do it. Just enjoy the tool how it wants to be used in your eyes. 

Unless I am your manager. Then, yes, please do exactly as these docs say.
